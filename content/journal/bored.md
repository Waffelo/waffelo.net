Past couple months I have fallen into this weird not doing anything
phase where I just sat around and did completely nothing. I let my
Linux system rot, I did not check up on my server, did not learn 
anything new, didn't do maintinance on anything. I really got a bit
of distaste in everything tech related for some time, maybe still for
now too. Well yeah, it appears that I am coming back to my tech based
hobbies. But I just got bored of it all, or maybe just burnt out from
setting up things for all days, doing nothing else than look into the
commandline for hours at time. Maybe I really just need something new.

### What do I even need?
