I am a twenty years old passionate open source software and hardware enthusiast from the Slovak Repubic, but living in the Czech Republic. I have studied programming of CNC and welding machinery. I am currently employeed. I am lead admin and founder of the Drgnz Club community which is a small community.

## My interests
There are quite a lot of things that I take interest in. I enjoy things such as film photography, journaling and reading books. But I also really enjoy doing 3D models in FreeCAD and 3D printing useful things. I run Linux on my server and even my personal computers. I really also like radio communication and electronics. And when it comes to physical activities, I like going for walks to the forest and meadows, basically comfy places. And I also am starting going to gym and for runs.

&nbsp;
## My system
I am currently daily driving Gentoo Linux with Sway WM on top of it. I use OpenRC as my init system and I preferably have mostly free software installed with few exceptions. One of my most favorite software gotta be Neovim, because I use it way too much.

When it comes to hardware, I chose to have everything AMD because it is the greatest option. I have a Ryzen 7 5700X CPU, Radeon RX6650XT GPU, 32GB of RAM and total of 7TB of storage installed.
