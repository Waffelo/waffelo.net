For the last couple weeks I have been thinking about starting
a new website more than usually. It was in my bucket list, however
I never really got to it because I didn't want to spend too much
time figuring confusing Hugo out. I could make purely html blog
website like I did many times before, but I didn't want that anymore.
Not being able to manage blog posts properly was a huge deal for me.
If i wanted to change something in website structure, I would have to
edit every single page, and I had many journal posts. This demotivated
me a lot in continuing with my websites and blogging.

Recently I have moved and got a new job. I finally got a tech related
job where I can also use computer. In this new job I sometimes need
to wait for some things for some periods of time, so why not use it for
things like learning, managing my server and redoing my website. So I
quickly set up neovim as IDE on my server and started doing it trough
SSH. This might seem strange, but I am forced to use Windows at work, which
is unusable for me. I don't really know how to use it, it feels dumb and
on top of that it is restricted as heck. Everything is connected to
different systems and Microsoft ecosystem. I barely can install software
because of the restrictions. I really would rather use bare TTY on Linux
than Windows itself.

## What now?
From this point, you can finally bookmark my website and check on it once in
a while, since it is set up in a better system which motivates me now. Or you
can also add this blog to your reader with [RSS](https://waffelo.net/posts/index.xml).
I will be actually trying to keep this blog alive now, since it is also giving
me some benefits like learning how to write better, finding interesting people,
expressing my ideas and some more.

## Is the website finished?
Absolutely not. I still have a lot of things to polish and change. I got the theme
from some randomg repository on Github (it is GPLv3) and it helped me understand
HUGO more, I would attribute the creator more but I feel like I changed the theme
nearly completely to my likings. But I think it was called Plague.

So, as some might know me. I am almost never pleased with the things I create, so my
website will keep getting edits and improvements. Who knows how long it will be until
I decide to create a new theme. But it certainly won't make the website inaccesible 
like it did before. So don't worry, if anyone even worries.

## What else is to be done?
There are quite a few things that need to be done on this website, like creating couple
new pages like store, fursona info, favorite pages, etc.. But I also need to tweak
the theme more, I need to figure out the layouts which I want to use, colors and shapes.
I want to redo the about me page completely, for now there will be text from my old
website as placeholder. I also want to play more with the index homepage more. You will
see by the time.

I will be also getting more stickers and illustrations for this website, I am currently
talking with my artist about the things like logos and icons.
